# Neovim Configuration

## Dependencies

Here are the extra dependencies to manage outside of the those handled by packer: 
+ Packer (need to install the package manager, with brew it's easier)
+ Java (just need jdk to install prettier)
+ Prettier (npm global install)
+ Lombok (for extensive java support)
