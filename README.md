# Neovim Configuration


## Dependencies
Here are the extra dependencies to manage outside of the those handled by packer: 
+ Packer (need to install the package manager, with brew it's easier)
+ Ripgrep (needed to run project search for string) : `brew install ripgrep`
+ Java (just need jdk to install prettier)
+ Prettier (npm global install)
+ Lombok (for extensive java support)




Configuration inspired by theprimeagen Neovim from scratch tutorial
